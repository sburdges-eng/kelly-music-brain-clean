# Repository Research Template for K2

## TARGET DOMAIN
[e.g., "JUCE audio plugin architecture" or "Python music emotion detection"]

## WHAT I NEED TO LEARN
[e.g., "How to structure VST3 parameter handling" or "Best practices for chord detection"]

## MY CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION
@[reference your existing file]
[e.g., @music_brain/harmony_tools.py or @PluginProcessor.cpp]

## RESEARCH TASK
You are a senior developer researching GitHub repositories to improve my codebase.

1. **Identify Top Repos:**
   - Search GitHub for repos matching: [domain]
   - Filter by: stars > 100, updated in last 2 years, active community
   - Focus on: production-ready code, good documentation, similar tech stack

2. **Extract Patterns:**
   - Code architecture (how they structure modules)
   - API design (function signatures, class hierarchies)
   - Performance optimizations
   - Error handling approaches
   - Testing strategies

3. **Compare to My Code:**
   - What am I doing right?
   - What can be improved?
   - What patterns should I adopt?
   - What anti-patterns should I avoid?

4. **Actionable Recommendations:**
   - Specific code changes (with examples)
   - Libraries/dependencies to add
   - Refactoring opportunities
   - Performance improvements

## OUTPUT FORMAT
### Top 5 Repositories
[Name, URL, stars, why it's relevant]

### Key Patterns Found
[Pattern name, code example, why it's better]

### Recommendations for My Code
[Specific, actionable changes with code diffs]
