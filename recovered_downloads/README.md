# Recovered from Downloads

Staged snapshots for comparison/merge:
- `kelly/`, `kelly 2/`, `kelly 3/`: Python Kelly packages with engines/core/intent schema and tests.
- `iDAW-copilot-merge-code-assets-workflows/`: Mixed C++/Python/pyproject bundles (bindings, penta-core, iDAW Core, plugins, tests).
- `files/kelly_melody_engine.py`: standalone engine script.

Excluded: Pentagon-core “bulling” variants and other non-music artifacts remain in Downloads; not staged here.
