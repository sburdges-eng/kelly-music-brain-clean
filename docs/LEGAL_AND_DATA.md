# Legal, Data, and Disclaimers

## Ownership
- User owns MIDI/arrangements produced by the tool.
- Samples/loops/templates shipped with the product are licensed for use per their terms; user must respect third-party licenses when importing references.

## Data & Privacy
- Opt-in only for data used to improve models; default is no retention of user audio/MIDI/intents.
- Opt-in scope: anonymized telemetry (errors, model provider, latency), optional reference embeddings for faster reuse.
- Local caches are user-clearable; cloud caches expire per retention policy (short-lived).

## Fair Use / Parody / Responsibility
- AI outputs may resemble styles; users are responsible for rights clearance and lawful use.
- Reference uploads must be user-owned or licensed; product provides analysis/generation, not distribution rights.
- For parody/fair-use claims, users must assess jurisdictional rules; tool provides no legal guarantee.

## Custom Models (ONNX)
- Custom ONNX allowed only after review/codesign; rejected models receive a validation report.
- Approved models are signed, versioned, and selectable with provenance shown to the user.

## Disclaimers in UI
- “AI-generated content; review before release.”
- “Latency warnings for cloud fallbacks.”
- “Opt-in data: off by default; toggle in settings; clears on disable.”
- “Rule-breaking presets may deviate from common-practice harmony; verify before client delivery.”
